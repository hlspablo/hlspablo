# Hello, I'm Pablo Henrique 👋

## About Me
I am a passionate and creative React and React Native developer with a strong focus on User Experience. 
I develop every feature with user experience, performance, and security in mind, as I believe that the rest are just consequences. 
I love to keep everything organized, flexible, and maintainable in my codebase, since success is the ultimate goal and the code should be prepared for it.
